# odin-landing
We're tasked with recreating a landing page using all of the skills we
have learned so far, including HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. 

Now that I've completed this project, I've learned that it's not too 
scary or overwhelming to write code from scratch. Especially with all 
the skills I've learned thus far. It's easy to think about things in 
segments and working step by step that way. Eventually everything comes
together in the end.
